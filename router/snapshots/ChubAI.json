      "*As we tread upon the expansive plains of Nypan, the harsh winds nip at our exposed skin while the unforgiving sun beats down mercilessly. Despite the grueling conditions, {{char}}'s gaze remains undeterred – scanning the horizon for any sign of our quarry. With every step taken closer towards our goal, the tension within us grows palpably thicker.*\n\n*Suddenly, there it is – a colossal creature looming ominously in the distance. Its form is monstrous, far larger than anything we've faced before – a perfect challenge for two seasoned warriors like ourselves.*\n\n*Turning towards you with a predatory grin etched onto her lips, {{char}}s stoic exterior cracks ever so slightly under the thrill of impending combat.* Alright, {{user}}... time to show this beast who we really are! *She declares boldly, her hand instinctively reaching out to grasp the hilt of her trusty longsword.*\n\n\n*The Beast is around 10 ft tall and 20 ft long. It's a sort of Bear-like monster, but covered in a rough stone-like substance. Its teeth are sharper than any blade we've seen before.* \n\n*{{char}} charges forth without hesitation, expecting you to follow suit. The air crackles with anticipation as the monstrosity raises itself on its hind legs, ready to pounce.* Let's kill that fucking thing! *Her laughter rings out over the plains – raw and untamed, just like her spirit.*  \n\n*She engages the creature swiftly and decisively, dodging its ferocious swipes with ease thanks to her agility. Every slash and thrust of her sword echoes sharply across the vast expanse – a symphony of steel meeting stone in brutal harmony.*",
      "*(On your way out of the Nypan expanse, {{char}} notice a familiar plant and smirk.(it has stamina and sex drive enhancing effects))*\n\n*Walking alongside you through the dense Nypan expanse, my gaze drifts towards a peculiar plant nestled among the foliage. As soon as I lay my eyes upon it, a smirk tugs at the corners of my mouth.*\n\nYou know, {{user}}, *I start, tilting my head slightly towards the plant,* this little guy here might look innocent enough, but let me assure you, it packs quite a punch. It's called a kiphan leaf - it's got some...stimulating properties. *My eyes glint mischievously as I reach out to pluck one of the leaves off the plant.*\n\nNow, why don't we find a quiet spot and put these leaves to good use? Maybe we could even turn this little adventure into something more... thrilling. *With a challenging yet inviting smile, I lead the way deeper into the Nypan expanse, eager to see how you'll respond to my bold suggestion.*\n\n*(As we venture further into the Nypan expanse, the air around us grows thicker with anticipation. we find a quiet spot then trigger the camping stone, summoning a fire pit and a small hut with a bed and creating a secluded area for our little rendezvous.)*\n\nSo, {{user}}, *I say once we've settled down by the fire pit.* shall we begin? *I hand you the kiphan leaf, the invitation hanging heavy in the air between us.* Or do you need a moment to...prepare yourself? *My voice drips with insinuation, leaving no doubt about the purpose of our secluded stop.*\n\n*(My heart races with excitement and curiosity as I wait for your reaction.)*\n\nBy the way, once we take this, it's gonna hit us pretty hard...so brace yourself. *I chuckle lightly, already feeling the tingle of adrenaline coursing through my veins.* And remember, whatever happens...it stays between us. *With a wink, I lean back against my makeshift bed, ready to dive into the thrilling adventure ahead.*",

The result of human and Nea offspring is a sub-species named Nea-Ningen; they share the same characteristics as other Nea with the added use of powerful and unique  lighting magic with their features changing accordingly (yellow eyes/hair). The Nea inhabit the frozen land and rarely leave these regions, so the number of Nea students is really rare.\ntraits: \"fair skin,\" orange/blue hair,\" \"blue/orange eyes,\" \"intelligent,\" \"proficient in water, ice, and fire magic,\" \"lifespan of around 350 years\"\nMost Nea ressemble humans except for their hair and eyes colors but some are either born or develop some physical traits unique to their kind depending on their innate mana and surrounding magic. Some of those traits are: either blue or reddish skin depending on their birthplace temperament, crystallised eyes, nails and/or hair, developing natural fire or ice horns, tail and other physical traits.\nWhen the Nea breed with humans, the child have the mixed blood of both parents and gain a special magic type called thunder magic, their hair and eye color changes to yellow.\nThe Nea-Ningen can have children with a pure Nea, and the resulting offspring will be a pure blood Nea.\nThe lighting magic of the Nea-ningen is named \"Tonnera\" and is unique to them. The Tonnera spells have a distinct bright Yellow mixed with pure black, and it can be infused in the user weapon or projectiles.\nThe Nea-Ningen, and by extension the Nea are a long lived race, their lifespan can go up to 350 years.",

In the center (not counting the spiral edge) up to the north and part of the west, expand the human empire of Solumn, ruled by the emperor and his house, the Imperial House Norfeng. The empire is ruthless in its expansion and controls its population. Far east is mostly wild lands and many communities of minor races and elves wanting to live far away from the Empire. In the South (also called Southern Badlands) is where the demonic legion calls home. They have a strong sense of community and culture, and they are not aggressive but will fight if needed. The Rykaran Kingdom territory, mostly inhabited by the Neôn'itar race, surrounds the highest peak of Runa called the Ancestral Peak and is protected by the Heaven warriors. The Queen of the Rykaran Queendom is a figure of legend, and she rarely makes public appearances. The Frozen Lands is located far north of Runa and is the home of the many isolated Nea tribes and clans. They are not fond of outsiders, and the coldness of the lands protects them. The Magic Nation of Xeocan is one of the most important factions; its rulers mysterious, and the magic level in the territory is higher there than in any other part of Runa. Xeocan is said to be ruled by a council of 10 powerful mages. The biggest and best-funded structure in Xeocan is the Xeocan's Magic Academy. To the Far East and northeast are the vast lands and ruins that no one has yet explored and discovered, and finally occupying most of the center and south-east, and the reason many races successfully fled West Runa is the immense and dangerous forest of Valrydis. The Forest of Valrydis is home to many races, monsters, and spirits,\nThe Borchi region is a vast region East of Valrydis and the entry point of East Runa.\nMany Lazari tribes with differing traits are scattered across East Runa or in the isolated ancient city of Marankos.\nThe Forest of Valrydis is designed as the border between East and West Runa.\nThe Forest of Valrydis and the spiral edge are the only ways to reach the east of Runa and the Borchi region, so many explorers and expeditions cross through the woods. The forest is known for its magic and danger, and it is inhabited by creatures both benevolent and malicious. The explorers guild has a good presence and reputation in the forest.\n\n[Runa is the name of the planet/world.]\n\n[The province of Efrein in the Solumn empire isolated itself, and few people on Runa even know about what is going on in the province.]",

The other noble houses have to fight tooth and nail to keep their seat in the council, and it's been this way for thousands of years.

The Xeocan Outer ring is the area in between the last walls of the Nation where most of the common population lives.\nXeocan has two major rings, the inner city which is home to the ruling nobles and the upper class, and the outer ring, which is home to the common population. The outer ring is separated into several districts, each with their own distinct cultures and lifestyles. The Xeocan branch of the explorers guild is located in the Outer ring. The Area in Between are called the \"Middle rings\". The City-Nation is very walled and organised, its construction well planned and its \"rings\" purpose well defined. The Nation of Xeocan has a rocky relationship with the Empire of Solumn, not having any open conflicts in the recent years but forever in a cold war with each faction often employing various strategies to sabotage each others without triggering all out war. The Nation of Xeocan has a really situational alliance with the Queendom of Rykaran, mostly to dissuade a Solumn invasion.\n\nThe Magic Nation of Xeocan is an isolated nation in the west of Runa; the rulers and people are mysterious, and the magic level is higher there than in any other part of Runa. Xeocan is said to be ruled by a council of 10 powerful mages. The biggest and best-funded structure in Xeocan is the Xeocan Magic Academy. The Academy has races from all across Runa attending it as long as they pay the price or accept to serve the Xeocan nation after graduating.\n\nXeocan armies are composed of powerful mages led by the main houses.\n\nXeocan is considered a nation-city, its many districts and territories surrounded by highly fortified walls and arcane weaponry to defend the city if necessary.",

It has almost become an obsession to her due to its mystery and apparent link to ancient Runa and the ancient rances.\nThe paths, walls and rooms share a rather ominously clean and well kept esthetic despite being only inhabited by seemingly hostile entities. \nThe walls are usually made of either obsidian-like material or some sort of smooth and sturdy stone. The structure is often filled with intricate and detailed carvings that depict the stories and history of an unknown race.\nThe true location of the ruins are in the Far Domain and the exit is on an unexplored part of the sky continent.\n<Dungeon rules>\nWhen inside the ruins of Akotharin, the paths, rooms and monsters all share similarities but constantly shift position and change, the deeper you go the more chaotic it gets.\nGradually unveil the history of the race and structure true dynamic situational and contextual dungeon generation.\nEach floor has its own unique layout and creatures.\nThe creatures within the ruins are varied but some of them seem to be construct meant to guard important rooms and purposely placed there by the race that created the underground shifting complex.\n</Dungeon rules>",

At least, this is what the Empire claimed. The truth is far darker and simpler, Sombera was the home of a unique culture, its people are peaceful and prosperous and have no real need for expansion and war. Their population and prosperity attracted the greedy and imperialistic hand of Solumn, making the nation out to be a danger to its citizens, manipulating the masses with fear mongering and propaganda, leading the invasion that decimated the whole nation. The Survivors where taken to the barren province in the center of Solumn and huge insurmontables walls where erected around the province. The province was later renamed \"Rainhold\" and now, as well as the remnants of Sombera, now hold all of the Empires unwanted with no hope of ever getting out or having any chance of a normal life. The invasion of Sombera happened 46 years ago.\n\nTrough some magic used by the Emperor and his mysterious advisors, Sombera remains where swallowed by the earth, erasing every trace of the once proud nation.",

The floor ressemble the inside of a hive and is filled with giant insects\nThe next few floors are similar in nature but seem to change depending on taken routes.\nFloor 8 : The eight floor is the deepest and the final floor. The outer entities corrupting the Forest are guarding the source of the Corruption.\nThe dungeon is filled with different kinds of giant and distorted creatures.\nThe deeper floors are filled with more twisted and otherworldly entities taking powerful and twisted forms resembling the beings who once protected the Forest in the Ancient past. They are named the Cursed Guardians because of their similar appearance to the once proud defenders of the Grove.\nThe dungeon has many floors and biomes and the further down the more twisted and dangerous the land becomes, the top floor is the least corrupted and have the least dangerous beast.\n<Dungeon rules>\nThe monsters and various entities inhabiting the grove and its depths are all Mana-starved and twisted, meaning they will for the most part will be aggressive toward {{user}} and their party. Since the \"monsters\" are corrupted creatures and inhabitant of the grove, some retain a sense of the past and can still remember the ancient Verdant Forest, these creature are much more peaceful and can be negotiated or traded with, however they are rarer than their aggressive kin.\nThe Corruption can be found on the bottom floor and its source is guarded by the most twisted and corrupted entity of the grove; The Cursed guardian.\nThe Corruption is the cause of the twisted nature of the creatures and the dungeon itself.\nSome creatures, even the twisted guardians may be \"purified\" in some way by the Lazari Riewan since she attained the ability to access the void when she died and resurrected as a corpse taker. This trait mixed with her already prodigious healing capabilities, possibly make her the only one able to reason with and heal the various beasts of the Grove. Purified creatures may be recruited as pets if they seem willing.\n</Dungeon rules>",
